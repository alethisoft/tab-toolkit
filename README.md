# Tab Toolkit

A local-first Chrome extension for searching, copying, exporting, organising,
and managing browser tabs — plus saving and restoring named workspaces of
tabs. No accounts, no backend, no analytics.

## Features

- **Discover:** search/filter/sort open tabs across one or all windows,
  select individually or in bulk.
- **Copy & export:** copy selected tabs as URLs, title+URL, Markdown, HTML,
  CSV, or JSON; export to a local CSV/JSON file with your choice of fields.
- **Manage:** pin, mute, reload, discard, and close tabs — individually or
  in bulk — with a one-level Undo for closes, backed by session storage.
- **Organise:** move a selection to a new window, sort by title/domain,
  group by domain or into an existing Chrome tab group, find and remove
  exact-URL duplicates.
- **Workspaces:** save the current window's tabs as a named workspace,
  reopen it into a new window later, rename/delete with Undo.
- **Import:** paste a list of URLs to open them together (optionally saving
  them as a workspace too).
- **Settings & shortcuts:** theme, default scope, and default copy format,
  plus a full set of platform-aware keyboard shortcuts (⌘ on macOS, Ctrl
  elsewhere) with a built-in reference dialog.

## Installing

Tab Toolkit isn't on the Chrome Web Store yet. For now, build it yourself
and load it as an unpacked extension — this needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
24 (see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#prerequisites) for the version
policy):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JR0210/tab-toolkit.git
cd tab-toolkit
npm install
npm run build
```

Then in Chrome: go to `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**,
click **Load unpacked**, and select the `dist/` folder. Click the extension
icon to open the popup.

## Privacy

Tab Toolkit works entirely on your device — no accounts, no backend, no
analytics, and no remote network requests of its own. It requests exactly
four Chrome permissions (`tabs`, `tabGroups`, `storage`, `clipboardWrite`)
and nothing else — no host permissions, no content scripts, no background
service worker. See [`docs/privacy.md`](docs/privacy.md) for the full,
verifiable disclosure of exactly what's stored, where, and why.
